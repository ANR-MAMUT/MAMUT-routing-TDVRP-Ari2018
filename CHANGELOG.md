# Changelog — Ari2018 TDVRP BKS

All notable changes to the curated `Ari2018` TDVRP best-known solutions (BKS) are recorded here. Objective: **Duration** (duration minimization — the depot departure time of each route is a decision variable). Costs are the authoritative output of the canonical checker (`mamut_routing_lib.td.check_td_solution`): exact IEEE-754 double arithmetic, no epsilon thresholds, routes in canonical order (sorted by first customer), total summed in that order — so any strict improvement is real. Reminder: this family is the VRP variant curated by Onyr (see README.md), so these BKS are not comparable with published TD-TSPTW results on the underlying raw files.

## 2026-07-06 — local-search sweep

All 160 BKS improved by the first sweep of kayros 0.2.0.dev0 TD-ACO with time-dependent local search (tree-evaluated VND, every accepted move repriced by the checker-identical fold), 10 seeds per instance on Grid'5000.

## 2026-07-06 — initial seeding sweep

Initial BKS population, 160/160: the TDVRP variant had no legacy solutions, so all BKS come from the initial large-scale seeding sweep across all four TD families run on 2026-07-04 (kayros 0.0.1 TD-ACO, Grid'5000, 10 seeds per instance, 13 520 runs total).

## 2026-07-03

Family populated (160 curated instances + ATF sidecars), no BKS yet.
